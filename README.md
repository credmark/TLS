# TLS - Token Legitimacy Score

The Token Legitimacy Score is an initiative from Credmark to help solve the spam token problem by assigning a "legitimacy score" to each token. It's an ambitious project that will only succeed with community input and participation.

Our hope is that this score can be used by applications in order to:

* help users deal with spam tokens by, for exammple, flagging or hiding them the way email clients deal with spam, 
* help projects / companies save resources by skipping computation associated with these tokens. 

This project comes out of pain we have experienced. Our customers ask us for token information. Because neither they nor we can distinguish between a legitimate and an illegitimte token, we waste time and energy processing these requests. Our customers' users then waste time and energy wondering what do do about these odd tokens in their wallets.  

If this project saves even one person from being scammed, it will have been worth the effort we have all put into it.

This repository hold the documentation and some source code for this project. The complete source code for the model will be available in this repository: https://github.com/credmark/credmark-models-py.
