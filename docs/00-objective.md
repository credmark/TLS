## Objective


A token legitimacy score is a measure of the authenticity and validity of a digital token or cryptocurrency. This score can be determined by various factors such as the token's history, the team behind it, the use case and adoption, and overall market sentiment. It can also depend on the level of decentralization and security of the blockchain network that the token is built on. The higher the score, the more legitimate the token is considered to be.

A token legitimacy score can be composed by evaluating various factors that are considered to be important indicators of a token's authenticity and validity. Some of these factors include:

    The team behind the token: The experience and credibility of the team behind the token can be a key indicator of its legitimacy.

    Use case and adoption: A token with a clear and practical use case, and evidence of adoption by users and businesses, can be seen as more legitimate.

    Market sentiment: The overall market sentiment towards a token can also be considered when composing a legitimacy score.

    Security and decentralization of the blockchain network: Tokens built on secure and decentralized blockchain networks are considered more legitimate than those built on less secure or centralized networks.

    Token history and development: A token's history and development, such as the launch date, the number of transactions and holders, also contribute to the score.

    Community and communication: Strong and active community and good communication from the token's development team can be an indicator of legitimacy

Each one of these factors can be assigned a weight and then a score can be generated based on the token's performance in each area, and the overall score can be used to determine the token's overall legitimacy.
